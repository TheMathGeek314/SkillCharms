# SkillCharms

Skills are now equippable charms. These include:
- Movement abilities
- Dream nail, dream gate, and awoken dream nail
- Spells
- Nail Arts
- Lumafly Lantern

Each skill will auto-equip itself once obtained and will grant the required quantity of additional notches.
Void spells will replace equipped white spells when obtained.

You cannot equip both light and dark versions of the same spell at the same time.

Although your inventory cannot visually display more than 12 notches, they still work as expected despite being invisible.

Granting and revoking skills via DebugMod is supported but charms will not auto-equip.

Randomizer files may not grant charms properly if the skill is non-vanilla.
